## Are you trying to sell me something? Is this a company? How do you make money?

This is not a commercial website. 
The only thing I'm try to sell you on is an idea: you can create a better space for you and your loved ones!

## Are you trying to burn down industrial social networks?

Not at all. Industrial social networks are fantastic tools for celebrities, institutions, companies are fantastic tools to stay in touch with their fans and customers.

If I want to know what Elon Musk is up to, Twitter is great.

If I want to see today's best cute animal GIFs, there's no place like Reddit.

If I want to connect with a long-lost friend from middle school, I'll probably try Facebook.

However, if I want to share my kid's pictures with grandma, or vent with my buddy about work, or organize a hike for the weekend, then I'd like to do so privately and securely. And far away from algorithms that will use this data against me.

## Won't criminals take advantage of organic technology for bad purposes?

It's possible. Maybe even likely. 
However there's a couple of things to keep in mind.

Criminals drive cars, text with mobile phones, shop at supermarkets, etc.
Should we make cars, mobile phones, supermarkets illegal because they "help" criminals?

Moreover, criminals have been using anonymous internet communications for decades.
They don't need our help, because they are 3 steps ahead.
Most of the technology discussed here is not "criminal grade". It's good for regular folks to avoid surveillance from big tech, but it's not strong enough to avoid law-enforcement agencies.
