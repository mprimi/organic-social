These are the main difference between "industrial" networks (the status quo) and the new wave of "organic" networks.

## üè≠ Industrial Social Media

Here's what makes today's social media "industrial":

 * For profit - your attention, your time and your private data are being sold to the highest bidder
 * Untrusted and opaque - you don't know who has access to your data and how it is stored, used, sold
 * Extractive - the content you create belongs to the platform, not you
 * Mediated - All your interactions with your friends go through an intermediary, who can decide at any time to deny you

Still, industrial social networks are extremely successful, revealing that people all over the world love this way of connecting and communicating.

## üå± Organic Social Media

What makes a network "organic":

 * Trusted - you personally know and trust the person operating the newtork
 * Small - used by groups of people that know each-other IRL.
 * Federated - smaller network can interconnect to form global-scale networks
 * User funded - in most cases, the cost of running an organic network is under a dollar per user per month
 * Private, secure and transparent - no data leaves the system without user's consent
 * Built on open-source software

Sounds too good to be true? üôÄ

It's not! Millions of people have already made the switch.

But it's no surprise you don't read about this in your (industrial) social media feed!
