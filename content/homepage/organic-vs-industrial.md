These are the main difference between "industrial" networks (the status quo) and the new wave of "organic" networks.

## üè≠ Industrial Social Networks

All the "famous" networks we all use are of the industrial kind: Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.

What makes these networks "industrial":

 * Exploitative - the business model is based on harvesting and selling personal data. A service is provided free of charge to incentivize you to you to share your most intimate details
 * Opaque - you don't know what data is collected, how it is used and processed, who it is sold to and for how much
 * Extractive - the content you create belongs to the platform
 * Global - constantly trying to grow, adding members until the entire world is "conquered"

Still, industrial social networks are extremely successful.
And it's undeniable they provide value to users.

However, giving you a space to connect with your friends is just a means to an end.
The real driver of these platforms is monetizing your data and your attention.

## üå± Organic Social Networks

Organic social networks already constitute a thriving underground reality.
Because they are not trying to take over the world, you may not have heard about them.

What makes a network "organic":

 * Small - used by groups of people that know each-other IRL: families, schools, group of friends, etc.
 * Trusted - you personally know and trust the person operating the network, and usually most of the people inhabiting it
 * User supported - the users pay for the infrastructure (usually, a few dollars a year)
 * Private and secure - no data or metadata is collected, sold or monetized. No data leaves the system without user's consent
 * Federated - smaller network can interconnect to form larger ones
 * Transparent - built on open-source software, managed with few simple rules that everyone can understand

Organic networks provide all the benefits of industrial social networks (i.e., giving you a space to connect with your loved ones), without any of the cost (i.e., monetization of your private data and your attention).

Sounds too good to be true? üôÄ

It's not! Organic social networks have been a reality for years, and millions of people are using them.

(No surprise, you won't hear about them within (industrial) social media feeds!)
