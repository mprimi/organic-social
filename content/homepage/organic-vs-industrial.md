These are the main difference between "industrial" networks (the status quo) and the new wave of "organic" networks.

## üè≠ Industrial Social Networks

Industrial networks are the "famous" household names: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

 * Exploitative: The business model is based on harvesting and selling personal information, and/or your attention.
 * Opaque: You don't know who has access to your data, source-code is closed, regulated by complex legal frameworks
 * Extractive: The content you create doesn't belong to you
 * Addictive: the more engaged you are, the more money they make, this creates an incentive to keep you hooked
 * Expansive: always trying to conquer more and more users

Still, industrial social networks are extremely successful.
And it's undeniable they provide value to users.

However, giving you a space to connect with your friends is just a means to an end.
The real driver of these platforms is monetizing your data and your attention.

## üå± Organic Social Networks

Organic social networks are a thriving underground ecosystem.
Because they are not trying to take over the world, most people are not even aware they exist!

 * Small: Used by groups of friends, families, schools, social clubs, etc.
 * Trustworthy: You personally know and trust the administrator, and most of the inhabitants
 * User supported: Users pitch in a few dollars a year to run the network
 * Private: no data or metadata is collected, sold or monetized. No data leaves the system without user's consent.
 * Federated: small network interconnect to form larger constellations
 * Transparent: built on open-source software, managed with few simple rules that everyone can understand

Organic social networks are just as fun and easy to use as industrial networks.

Without any of the downsides.

Where's the catch?
 * They cost money ($5-10 a year per user, to keep the server lights on)
 * You need to personally know someone that would take you on as user

Paying $10 a year may seem like a good deal you're willing to take.

But finding a trusted friend that runs an organic network may not be so easy.
