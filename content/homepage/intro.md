Social networks and Social media have revolutionized the way people connect and interact.

They allow us to stay in touch with loved ones regardless of physical distance.
Share our passions and interests with people all over the world.

But at what cost?
Social networks are first and foremost instruments to make money.

We all know the old adage "If you're not paying for it, then YOU are the product!".
Data is the new oil, and all the modern social media companies are extracting and selling it without much regards for the consequences.

Is this the best we can do? Definitely not!

Current-generation social media is just the beginning.
It's time to evolve past it!
