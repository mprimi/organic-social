Social networks and Social media have revolutionized the way people connect and interact.
They allow us to stay in touch with loved ones regardless of physical distance.

However, large social networks are just Trojan Horses!

They enter into our lives as friendly tools to help us connect.
In reality, they are tools to extract vast amount of personal data ("the new oil").
They keep us engaged so they can sell our attention to the highest bidder ("the attention economy").

Because there's a lot of money at stake, and the competition is fierce, social networks have been pursuing more and more aggressive and subtle strategies to keep people sharing and keep people engaged.

What if we could keep all the good parts of social networks (convenience, connection) without any of the downsides (exploitation, division)?
