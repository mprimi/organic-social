Social networks and Social media have revolutionized the way people connect and interact. 
They allow us to stay in touch with loved ones, discuss current events, and hang out online.

Tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, rack in hundreds of million of dollars a year, all while offering a FREE service!
Ever wondered how this is possible?

Here's a simplified view of how "industrial" social networks work:

"Industrial" social networks are profit-driven ventures.
The more time users spend using, the more money is generated.

And because competition is fierce, companies have been getting more and more aggressive about capturing our attention.
Using all sorts of mind-tricks to keep us engaged and to keep the user base growing.

Is this hopeless? Is getting tracked and manipulated a fair price for being able to talk to our friends?

Not at all. 
There's a better way!
