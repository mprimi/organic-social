Industrial social networks are fantastic tools for celebrities, institutions, companies are fantastic tools to stay in touch with their fans and customers.</p><p>If I want to know what Elon Musk is up to, Twitter is great.</p><p>If I want to see today&rsquo;s best cute animal GIFs, there&rsquo;s no place like Reddit.</p><p>If I want to connect with a long-lost friend from middle school, I&rsquo;ll probably try Facebook.</p><p>However, if I want to share my kid&rsquo;s pictures with grandma, or vent with my buddy about work, or organize a hike for the weekend, then I&rsquo;d like to do so privately and securely. And far away from algorithms that will use this data against me.</p><hr><h2 id=wont-criminals-take-advantage-of-organic-technology-for-bad-purposes>Won&rsquo;t criminals take advantage of organic technology for bad purposes?</h2><p>It&rsquo;s possible. Maybe even likely.
However there&rsquo;s a couple of things to keep in mind.</p><p>Criminals drive cars, text with mobile phones, shop at supermarkets, etc.
Should we make cars, mobile phones, supermarkets illegal because they &ldquo;help&rdquo; criminals?</p><p>Moreover, criminals have been using anonymous internet communications for decades.
They don&rsquo;t need our help, because they are 3 steps ahead.
Most of the technology discussed here is not &ldquo;criminal grade&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s good for regular folks to avoid surveillance from big tech, but it&rsquo;s not strong enough to avoid law-enforcement agencies.</p><hr></section></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=http://www.organic-social.net>www.organic-social.net</a></section><section></section></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.organic-social.net/js/icons.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.organic-social.net/js/index.js></script></body></html>
